        1. At the point of admission to Chrysalis it is made clear to all prospective pupils and their parents that they are expected to co-operate with the teaching and support staff and to promote the greater good of the whole Private School community. We also wish to establish a full partnership with parents to promote the interests of the pupil body. This partnership must be based upon mutual honesty and respect.
        2. We have the right to expect full disclosure of any learning support assessment or identified need, or medical condition or disability, which could require specialist treatment, support or equipment, and any behavioural or disciplinary issues known to parents at the point of application, and thereafter.
        3. We seek to offer places to those whom we believe can contribute positively to the Private School community, and whom we can educate and safeguard within our own teaching, pastoral and learning support structure.
        4. Boys and girls who apply to the school must meet the school's academic entrance requirements. From Grade R up to Grade 9 we require that the pupil is on standard regarding the Discipline subjects. We reserve the right to make direct contact with any previous school or educational establishment and to request a confidential report. This will ask for comment on academic progress to date, involvement in the broader life of the school and general behavioural standards.
        5. Collectively, all this information allows Chrysalis to be reasonably sure that it is the right facility academically for each boy or girl and to tailor our academic courses to meet the needs of the pupils. Chrysalis wants to be able to educate and develop each pupil to the best of his or her ability and to ensure that any prospective pupil will be academically and socially at ease with his or her peers. In this way there is every chance that all pupils will emerge at the end of their time at Chrysalis having enjoyed the experience, being confident in their next steps.
        6. Progression from one part of Chrysalis to another is expected but cannot be guaranteed: there are occasions when such progression is not in the interests of the child. In such circumstances we would inform the parents well in advance and offer guidance as to future options for schooling.
        7. All those joining Chrysalis must agree to abide by the Standard terms and Conditions and to adhere to relevant school rules and policies.
        8. The School hereby reserves the right in its sole and absolute discretion to give notice of termination of this agreement to the parent of a month’s notice which notice period need not be a calendar month. However, should such circumstances arise which in the sole and absolute discretion of the Principal or her nominee warrant immediate termination by the School of its agreement with the parent, the School shall be entitled to forthwith and without any notice period terminate this agreement with the parent.
        9. A GED matric through GED-online or the Cambridge International Exam through the British Council are the only school leaving certificates facilitated by Chrysalis.
        10. What follows is the rationale behind Chrysalis’s current legal status as a civil education institution.
        A. The parent has the primary responsibility to secure, direct and guide their child’s education. B. Chrysalis henceforth is a school, functions as a school and will be recognised as a civil education institution. C. A decision was made in October 2015 to register Chrysalis with the Limpopo Department of Education and with ISASA (the Independent Schools Association of South Africa). Registration with ISASA ensures a degree of autonomy regarding curriculum choices and enrolment policies.
